Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms
======

This is the source code to a Java implementation of three minimum spanning tree algorithms called Prim's, Boruvka's and Kruskal's algorithms. A graph is read from 'input.txt' in which it is stored as an adjacency matrix. After this the minimum spanning tree is calculated using one of the three algorithms and the resulting graph is printed out.

For more information have a look at a paper written on the topic [here](http://www.students.tut.fi/~podsechi/MinimumSpanningTreeAlgorithms_IgorPodsechin.pdf).
